__builtin_popcount(number)-return number of set bits in the binary representation of the number.

unique(v.begin(),v.end())- removes continuous duplicates from vector.

number<<k - left shift a number k times - 2^k * number

number>>k -right shift a number k  - floor(number/2^k)

bitset<sizeofbinarynumber> binary_string;
size of binary string can be very large in bitset and should be some fixed value, by default value is zero.
binary_string.count() - returns the number of set bit in the string.
binary_string can be treated as an array with every element either 0 or 1.
